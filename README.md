# **Week 0 : Assignment**

In this assignment for the project "Diving into ML", we shall explore the basics of coding with Python which will be required for future programming assignments as well as implementation of any ML models.

This week's programming assignment has a jupyter notebook which contains the problem statement. You are supposed to fill in missing code wherever indicated and provide detailed observations wherever asked.

Your assignment will be scored on the basis of : 

* Error-free execution
* Accuracy of results obtained
* Well-formatted graphs
* Detailed analysis whenever observations are asked
* Good programming practices (such as comments, indentation)

The deadline for the submission of this assignment is 24 December, 11:59 PM

Any doubts/suggestions can be asked on the group. All resources required including the libraries to be used, the dataset to be used have been linked in the notebook.
